      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should increase by 1.
      - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been liked by the user.
    - [x] If previously liked:
      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should decrease by 1.
      - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been unliked by the user.

- [x] **Shuffle Songs**

  - [x] When the page is refreshed or reloaded, a new random playlist is displayed
    - For example, navigating to the all playlists page and then back to the featured playlist page should result in a new random playlist being displayed
    - Note that because your algorithm will not be truly random, it is possible that the same playlist will feature twice in a row. 
    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself refreshing the featured page more than once. 
  - [x] Application includes a navigation bar or some other mechanism such that users can navigate to the page with all playlists from the featured page and vice versa without using the browser's back and forward buttons.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, all the labs definitely prepared me to complete the assignment. It was very useful to have been able to practice using the API keys in class instead of jumping to the project. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have integrated more stretch features, however I really wanted to add the sorting system specifically the one that organizes the playlists by language because I have some spanish playlists. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
